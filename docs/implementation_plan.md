# SmellyCoin Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the SmellyCoin blockchain with a focus on the synchronization system and JSON-RPC API.

## Current Status

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the following components that are already in place:

1. **Network Module**: Basic peer discovery and message handling is implemented
2. **Synchronization Framework**: The sync.rs file contains a partial implementation of block synchronization
3. **JSON-RPC Framework**: The RPC module has a basic structure with some methods implemented
4. **Mining Implementation**: CPU mining is implemented and functional

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Complete Block Synchronization System

- **Block Download Manager**:
  - Implement parallel block downloading from multiple peers
  - Add timeout and retry mechanisms for failed downloads
  - Implement block validation during synchronization

- **Header Synchronization**:
  - Complete the header synchronization logic
  - Implement checkpoints for faster initial sync
  - Add validation for difficulty adjustments

- **Peer Management During Sync**:
  - Track peer reliability during synchronization
  - Ban or deprioritize unreliable peers
  - Implement adaptive download speed based on peer performance

### 2. Enhance JSON-RPC API

- **Complete Core API Methods**:
  - Implement remaining blockchain query methods
  - Add transaction submission and validation methods
  - Implement wallet-related methods for key management

- **Mining API Methods**:
  - Add methods for getblocktemplate and submitblock
  - Implement getmininginfo and getnetworkhashps
  - Add stratum mining server control methods

- **Network API Methods**:
  - Implement peer management methods
  - Add network statistics methods
  - Implement methods for manual synchronization control

- **Security and Authentication**:
  - Implement proper authentication for RPC calls
  - Add IP-based access control
  - Implement TLS support for secure connections

### 3. Configuration System

- **Enhance Configuration File**:
  - Add synchronization-specific configuration options
  - Implement JSON-RPC authentication configuration
  - Add network-specific configuration options

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Add commands for controlling synchronization
  - Implement RPC client functionality
  - Add blockchain management commands

### 4. Documentation

- **Update API Documentation**:
  - Complete the JSON-RPC API documentation
  - Document all available methods and parameters
  - Add examples for common operations

- **Node Setup Guide**:
  - Enhance the node setup documentation
  - Add detailed instructions for genesis node initialization
  - Document the process for joining existing networks

## Implementation Sequence

1. Complete the synchronization system first, as it's fundamental to node operation
2. Implement the JSON-RPC API methods that interact with the synchronization system
3. Enhance the configuration system to support both components
4. Update documentation to reflect the new functionality
5. Integrate all components in the main application

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between synchronization and RPC systems
- **Network Tests**: Test synchronization with multiple nodes
- **Performance Tests**: Measure synchronization speed and resource usage

## Deployment Considerations

- Ensure backward compatibility with existing nodes
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add monitoring capabilities for node operators
- Consider resource usage on different hardware configurations
